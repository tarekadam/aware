    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>We the undersigned wish to introduce ourselves as the Aware Parents Group. In this open letter we hope
        to provide a fair and defensible policy platform to be adopted by school administration.</p>

    <p>Members of the Aware Parents Group are committed to the development and well-being of children within the school
        environment. We request that our school remain neutral on issues of politics, religion, and trending ideologies.
        The best interests of the students will be served by having the school focused on academics, the arts, physical
        activity, and good nutrition.</p>

    <h2>Inclusion</h2>
    <p>We assert that a community can not be formed through policy. Community forms through shared goals, efforts and
        experiences. The school's project based learning philosophy and applied strategies have successfully formed our
        community and require no additional policies.</p>

    <p>Further to that point, we do not accept the premise that any policies or re-education to enforce compelled speech
        and use of individualistic pronouns will yield inclusion or community. We oppose policy shifts aimed at
        enforcing compelled speech and individualistic pronouns in the name of 'inclusion.' We firmly support the
        current policies that encourage 'participation.'</p>

    <h2>Dignity, Privacy, and Family Values</h2>
    <p>Dignity, Privacy, and Family Values are fundamental aspects that contribute to the harmonious coexistence and
        overall well-being of everyone within our diverse community. The dignity provided by privacy ensures that
        individuals have the freedom to make personal choices without fear of judgment or intrusion.</p>

    <p>In its current form, our community happens to include heterosexuality, homosexuality, polygamy, males, females,
        gender dysphoria and so on. However, there is no community benefit or personal dignity when these topics take
        center stage. It is more likely to be destructive to the community and embarrassing to particular individuals.
        While such private matters are not relevant to any aspect of the school, we note that the administration is
        currently positioned to uphold or revoke the dignity, privacy and values of families within the community
        through its shifts in messaging and pending policy decisions.</p>

    <h2>Local Community Integration</h2>
    <p>Our School has a well-earned local reputation for the efforts and resources that have gone into the surrounding
        communities. Indeed, it has been the school's mission of providing education to students from diverse backgrounds.
        This is what was, until recently, termed as 'inclusion'. We firmly believe that by maintaining a focus on
        academics, arts, physical education, and good nutrition, we can best serve the needs and aspirations of our
        students and keep our reputation in good standing.</p>

    <p>While visiting families has undeniably enriched our school community, we must also acknowledge and respect the
        local community and its culture. In recent times, we have observed an increasing influence of foreign concepts
        and values that, although well-intentioned, may detract from our school's mission and permanently damage the
        schools local reputation. In particular, foreign trends of a sexual nature will devastate the reputation of the
        school.</p>

    <h2>Sexual Education</h2>
    <p>The Aware Parents Group advocates for sexual health communication plans that are scaled appropriately to the role
        of an academic institution. Discussion of sex/sexuality, gender/genitalia to an under-aged audience must
        have clear limits, oversight, and individual parental approval.</p>

    <p>As a group, we require that the school limit sexual education to topics of biological relevance and health. Such
        issues include STDs, pregnancy and contraception. This limited volume of sexual health content is clearly a
        small subset of the topic, however it is the subset that will keep our children healthy as they go through
        adolescence. Nothing less, nothing more. We again note that parental approval must be acquired as a prerequisite
        to any such presentation of material.</p>

    <h2>Media Awareness</h2>
    <p>We believe the school can do a great deal more to train and guide staff in areas of modern media. There are several
        ways in which online platforms can be detrimental to communities.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Controversial or divisive topics get more comments and therefor more viewer distribution while simple,
            logical facts garner no comments or feedback. As a result, informative posts are not reaching a wide
            audience.
        </li>
        <li>
            It has become common to see economists publicly discuss environmental issues, psychologists publicly discuss
            biological issues, and so on. It is very misleading when experts operate outside their field.
        </li>
        <li>
            Having instant access to vast amounts of content is not the same as having access to facts. However, it can
            leave people with the impression that they are informed. A common secondary mistake is to assert that others
            are wrong.
        </li>
        <!--<li>
            Self glorification on social media has popularized narcissistic personality traits. Such self-centric ideals
            are not compatible with community. Exacerbating this issue are the filters which lead to a distortion of
            self-image or even delusion.
        </li>-->
        <li>The combined effect is potently misleading and divisive for communities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Resolution</h1>
    <p>Based on the above rationale, we strongly urge the school to adopt a Swedish type neutrality in all areas
        beyond its scope. In particular, we advocate for neutrality on issues of politics, religion, and trending
        ideologies. <!--We also recommend working with authorities and training staff to report any
        <b><i>M</i></b>istreatment
        <b><i>I</i></b>nvolving
        <b><i>A</i></b>dolescence.-->
        Thank you for your time and consideration, we look forward to collaborating.</p>
